<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>The following pages must not be considered as comprising
an exhaustive Glossary of our Wiltshire Folk-speech. The
field is a wide one, and though much has been accomplished
much more still remains to be done. None but those who
have themselves attempted such a task know how difficult it
is to get together anything remotely approaching a complete
list of the dialect words used in a single small parish, to say
nothing of a large county, such as ours. Even when the
words themselves have been collected, the work is little more
than begun. Their range in time and place, their history and
etymology, the side-lights thrown on them by allusions in
local or general literature, their relation to other English
dialects, and a hundred such matters, more or less interesting,
have still to be dealt with. However, in spite of many difficulties
and hindrances, the results of our five years or more
of labour have proved very satisfactory, and we feel fully
justified in claiming for this <cite>Glossary</cite> that it contains the
most complete list of Wiltshire words and phrases which
has as yet been compiled. More than one-half of the words
here noted have never before appeared in any Wiltshire
Vocabulary, many of them being now recorded for the first
time for any county, while in the case of the remainder
much additional information will be found given, as well
as numerous examples of actual folk-talk.</p>

<p>The greater part of these words were originally collected
by us as rough material for the use of the compilers of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
projected <cite>English Dialect Dictionary</cite>, and have been appearing
in instalments during the last two years in the <cite>Wilts Archæological
Magazine</cite> (vol. xxvi, pp. 84-169, and 293-314; vol.
xxvii, pp. 124-159), as <cite>Contributions towards a Wiltshire
Glossary</cite>. The whole list has now been carefully revised and
much enlarged, many emendations being made, and a very
considerable number of new words inserted, either in the
body of the work, or as <i>Addenda</i>. A few short stories, illustrating
the dialect as actually spoken now and in Akerman's
time, with a brief <i>Introduction</i> dealing with Pronunciation, &amp;c.,
and <i>Appendices</i> on various matters of interest, have also been
added; so that the size of the work has been greatly
increased.</p>

<p>As regards the nature of the dialect itself, the subject
has been fully dealt with by abler pens than ours, and
we need only mention here that it belongs to what is
now known as the South-Western group, which also comprises
most of Dorset, Hants, Gloucester, and parts of Berks
and Somerset. The use of dialect would appear gradually
to be dying out now in the county, thanks, perhaps, to
the spread of education, which too often renders the rustic
half-ashamed of his native tongue. Good old English as at
base it is,&mdash;for many a word or phrase used daily and hourly
by the Wiltshire labourer has come down almost unchanged,
even as regards pronunciation, from his Anglo-Saxon forefathers,&mdash;it
is not good enough for him now. One here, and
another there, will have been up to town, only to come back
with a stock of slang phrases and misplaced aspirates, and
a large and liberal contempt for the old speech and the old
ways. The natural result is that here, as elsewhere, every
year is likely to add considerably to the labour of collecting,
until in another generation or so what is now difficult may
become an almost hopeless task. No time should be lost,
therefore, in noting down for permanent record every word
and phrase, custom or superstition, still current among us,
that may chance to come under observation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span></p>

<p>The words here gathered together will be found to fall
mainly under three heads;&mdash;(1) Dialect, as <i>Caddle</i>, (2) Ordinary
English with some local shade of meaning, as <i>Unbelieving</i>, and
(3) Agricultural, as <i>Hyle</i>, many of the latter being also
entitled to rank as Dialect. There may also be noted a small
number of old words, such as <i>toll</i> and <i>charm</i>, that have long
died out of standard English, but still hold their own among
our country people. We have not thought it advisable, as
a general rule, to follow the example set us by our predecessors
in including such words as <i>archet</i> and <i>deaw</i>, which merely
represent the local pronunciation of orchard and dew; nor
have we admitted <i>cantankerous</i>, <i>tramp</i>, and certain others that
must now rank with ordinary English, whatever claim they
may once have had to be considered as provincial. More
leniency, however, has been exercised with regard to the
agricultural terms, many that are undoubtedly of somewhat
general use being retained side by side with those of more
local limitation.</p>

<p>The chief existing sources of information are as follows:&mdash;(1)
the Glossary of Agricultural Terms in Davis's <cite>General
View of the Agriculture of Wilts</cite>, 1809; reprinted in the
<cite>Archæological Review</cite>, March, 1888, with many valuable notes
by Prof. Skeat; (2) The Word-list in vol. iii. of Britton's
<cite>Beauties of Wilts</cite>, 1825; collated with Akerman, and reprinted
in 1879 for the English Dialect Society, with additions
and annotations, by Prof. Skeat; (3) Akerman's
<cite>North Wilts Glossary</cite>, 1842, based upon Britton's earlier work;
(4) Halliwell's <cite>Dictionary</cite>, 1847, where may be found most
(but not all) of the Wiltshire words occurring in our older
literature, as the anonymous fifteenth-century <cite>Chronicon Vilodunense</cite>,
the works of John Aubrey, Bishop Kennett's <cite>Parochial
Antiquities</cite>, and the collections by the same author, which
form part of the <cite>Lansdowne MSS.</cite>; (5) Wright's <cite>Dictionary of
Obsolete and Provincial English</cite>, 1859, which is mainly a condensation
of Halliwell's work, but contains a few additional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
Wiltshire words; (6) a Word-list in Mr. E. Slow's <cite>Wiltshire
Poems</cite>, which he has recently enlarged and published separately;
and (7) the curious old MS. <cite>Vocabulary</cite> belonging to
Mr. W. Cunnington, a <i>verbatim</i> reprint of which will be
found in the Appendix.</p>

<p>Other authorities that must here be accorded a special
mention are a paper <cite>On some un-noted Wiltshire Phrases</cite>, by
the Rev. W. C. Plenderleath, in the <cite>Wilts Archæological
Magazine</cite>; Britten and Holland's invaluable <cite>Dictionary of
English Plant-names</cite>, which, however, is unfortunately very
weak as regards Wilts names; the Rev. A. C. Smith's <cite>Birds
of Wiltshire</cite>; Akerman's <cite>Wiltshire Tales</cite>; the <cite>Flower-class
Reports</cite> in the <cite>Sarum Diocesan Gazette</cite>; the very scarce <cite>Song
of Solomon in North Wilts Dialect</cite>, by Edward Kite, a work
of the highest value as regards the preservation of local pronunciation
and modes of expression, but containing very few
words that are not in themselves ordinary English; the works
of Richard Jefferies; Canon Jackson's valuable edition of
Aubrey's <cite>Wiltshire Collections</cite>; and Britton's condensation of
the <cite>Natural History of Wilts</cite>. In <cite>Old Country and Farming
Words</cite>, by Mr. Britten, 1880, much information as to our
agricultural terms may be found, gathered together from the
<cite>Surveys</cite> and similar sources. Lastly, the various <cite>Glossaries</cite>
of the neighbouring counties, by Cope, Barnes, Jennings,
and other writers, should be carefully collated with our
Wiltshire Glossaries, as they often throw light on doubtful
points. Fuller particulars as to these and other works bearing
on the subject will be found in the Appendix on <cite>Wiltshire
Bibliography</cite>.</p>

<p>We regret that it has been found impossible to carry out
Professor Skeat's suggestion that the true pronunciation
should in all doubtful cases be clearly indicated by its Glossic
equivalent. To make such indications of any practical value
they should spring from a more intimate knowledge of that
system than either of us can be said to possess. The same
remarks will also apply to the short notes on Pronunciation,
&amp;c., where our utter inexperience as regards the modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
scientific systems of Phonetics must be pleaded as our excuse
for having been compelled to adopt methods that are as vague
as they are unscientific.</p>

<p>To the English Dialect Society and its officers we are
deeply indebted for their kindness and generosity in undertaking
to adopt this <cite>Glossary</cite>, and to publish it in their
valuable series of County Glossaries, as well as for the
courtesy shown us in all matters connected with the work.
We have also to thank the Wilts Archæological Society for
the space afforded us from time to time in their <cite>Magazine</cite>,
and the permission granted us to reprint the <i>Word-lists</i>
therefrom.</p>

<p>In our <i>Prefaces</i> to these <i>Word-lists</i> we mentioned that we
should be very glad to receive any additions or suggestions
from those interested in the subject. The result of these
appeals has been very gratifying, not only with regard to the
actual amount of new material so obtained, but also as showing
the widespread interest felt in a branch of Wiltshire
Archæology which has hitherto been somewhat neglected,
and we gladly avail ourselves of this opportunity of repeating
our expression of thanks to all those who have so kindly
responded. To Dr. Jennings we owe an extremely lengthy
list of Malmesbury words, from which we have made
numerous extracts. We have found it of special value, as
showing the influence of Somersetshire on the vocabulary and
pronunciation of that part of the county. To Sir C. Hobhouse
we are indebted for some interesting words, amongst which
the survival of the A.S. <i>attercop</i> is well worth noting. We
have to thank Mr. W. Cunnington for assistance in many
ways, and for the loan of MSS. and books, which we have
found of great service. To Mr. J. U. Powell and Miss Kate
Smith we owe the greater part of the words marked as occurring
in the Deverill district. Mr. E. J. Tatum has given us much
help as regards local Plant-names: Miss E. Boyer-Brown,
Mr. F. M. Willis, Mr. E. Slow, Mr. James Rawlence, Mr.
F. A. Rawlence, Mr. C. E. Ponting, Mr. R. Coward, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
Rev. W. C. Plenderleath, Mr. Septimus Goddard, Mrs. Dartnell,
the Rev. C. Soames, and the Rev. G. Hill must also be
specially mentioned. We are indebted to Mr. W. Gale,
gardener at Clyffe Pypard Vicarage, for valuable assistance
rendered us in verifying words and reporting new ones.</p>

<p>We take this opportunity of acknowledging gratefully the
assistance which we have throughout the compilation of this
<cite>Glossary</cite> received from H. N. Goddard, Esq., of the Manor,
Clyffe Pypard, to whose wide knowledge and long experience
of Wiltshire words and ways we owe many valuable suggestions;
from the Rev. A. Smythe-Palmer, D.D., who has taken
much interest in the work, and to whose pen we owe many
notes; from Professor Skeat, who kindly gave us permission
to make use of his reprints; and last, but by no means least,
from the Rev. A. L. Mayhew, who most kindly went through
the whole MS., correcting minutely the etymologies suggested,
and adding new matter in many places.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we would say that we hope from time to
time to publish further lists of <i>Addenda</i> in the <cite>Wilts Archæological
Magazine</cite> or elsewhere, and that any additions and
suggestions will always be very welcome, however brief they
may be. The longest contributions are not always those of
most value, and it has more than once happened that words
and phrases of the greatest interest have occurred in a list
whose brevity was its only fault.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>


<p>The following notes may perhaps serve to give some slight
indication as to pronunciation, &amp;c., but without the aid of
Glossic it is impossible accurately to reproduce the actual
sounds.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><i>A</i> is usually lengthened out or broadened in some way or
other.</p>

<p>Thus in <i>hazon</i> and <i>haslet</i> it would be pronounced somewhat
as in <i>baa</i>, this being no doubt what the <cite>Monthly Magazine</cite>
means by saying that '<i>a</i> is always pronounced as <i>r</i>.'</p>

<p>When <i>a</i> is immediately followed by <i>r</i>, as in <i>ha'sh</i>, harsh, and
<i>paa'son</i>, parson, the result is that the <i>r</i> appears to be altogether
dropped out of the word.</p>

<p><i>Aw</i> final always becomes <i>aa</i>, as <i>laa</i>, law, <i>draa</i>, draw, <i>thaa</i>,
thaw.</p>

<p>In <i>saace</i>, sauce, <i>au</i> becomes <i>aa</i>.</p>

<p><i>A</i> is also broadened into <i>eä</i>.</p>

<p>Thus <i>garden</i>, <i>gate</i>, and <i>name</i> become <i>geärden</i>, <i>geät</i>, and <i>neäme</i>.</p>

<p>These examples may, however, be also pronounced in other
ways, even in the same sentence, as <i>garne</i>, <i>y&#259;t</i>, and <i>naayme</i>, or
often <i>ne-um</i>.</p>

<p><i>A</i> is often softened in various ways.</p>

<p>Thus, <i>thrash</i> becomes <i>draish</i>, and <i>wash</i>, <i>waish</i> or <i>weish</i>.</p>

<p>It is often changed to <i>o</i>, as <i>zot</i>, sat, <i>ronk</i>, rank.</p>

<p>Also to <i>e</i>, as <i>piller</i>, pillar, <i>refter</i>, rafter, <i>pert</i>, part.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span></p>

<p>In <i>vur</i>, far, the sound is <i>u</i> rather than <i>e</i>.</p>

<p>The North Wilts version of the <cite>Song of Solomon</cite> gives frequent
examples of <i>oi</i> for <i>ai</i>, as <i>choir</i>, chair, <i>foir</i>, fair, <i>moyden</i>,
maiden; but this is probably an imported letter-change, <i>chayer</i>
or <i>chai-yer</i>, for instance, being nearer the true sound.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><i>E</i> is often broadened into <i>aa</i> or <i>aay</i>.</p>

<p>Thus <i>they</i> gives us <i>thaay</i>, and <i>break</i>, <i>braayke</i>.</p>

<p>In <i>marchant</i>, merchant, and <i>zartin</i>, certain, the sound given
is as in <i>tar</i>.</p>

<p><i>Ei</i> takes the sound of <i>a</i> in <i>fate</i>, as <i>desave</i>, deceive.</p>

<p><i>Left</i>, <i>smell</i>, and <i>kettle</i> become <i>lift</i>, <i>smill</i>, and <i>kiddle</i>.</p>

<p>In South Wilts <i>&#277;</i> in such words as <i>egg</i> or <i>leg</i> becomes <i>a</i> or <i>ai</i>,
giving us <i>aig</i> and <i>laig</i> or <i>l&#259;g</i>. Thus a Heytesbury Rosalind
would render&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'O Jupiter, how weary are my legs!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>by 'O-my-poor-vit'n-laigs!' uttered all in one gasp. In
N. Wilts the <i>e</i> in these words is not perceptibly so altered.</p>

<p>The <i>&#277;</i> in such words as <i>linnet</i> usually takes the <i>u</i> sound,
giving us <i>linnut</i>. In <i>yes</i> it is lengthened out into <i>eece</i> in
S. Wilts, and in N. Wilts into <i>cez</i>.</p>

<p>Long <i>e</i> or <i>ee</i> is shortened into <i>i</i>, as <i>ship</i>, sheep, <i>kippur</i>, keeper,
<i>wick</i>, week, <i>fit</i>, <i>vit</i>, feet, the latter word sometimes being also
pronounced as <i>ve-ut</i>.</p>

<p><i>Heat</i> becomes <i>het</i>, and <i>heater</i> (a flat-iron), <i>hetter</i>; while <i>hear</i> is
usually <i>hire</i> in N. Wilts.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><i>I</i> short becomes <i>e</i>, as <i>breng</i>, bring, <i>drenk</i>, drink, <i>zet</i>, sit, <i>pegs</i>,
pigs.</p>

<p>Occasionally it is lengthened into <i>ee</i>, as <i>leetle</i>, little.</p>

<p>In <i>hit</i> (<i>pret.</i>) and <i>if</i> it usually takes the sound of <i>u</i>, as <i>hut</i>
and <i>uf</i> or <i>uv</i>; but <i>hit</i> in the present tense is <i>het</i>, and <i>if</i> is often
sounded as <i>ef</i> in N. Wilts.</p>

<p>At the beginning of a word, <i>im</i>, <i>in</i>, and <i>un</i> usually become
<i>on</i>, as <i>onpossible</i>, <i>ondacent</i>, <i>oncommon</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span></p>

<p>In present participles the sound given varies between <i>un'</i>,
<i>en'</i>, and <i>in'</i>, the <i>g</i> almost invariably being dropped.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><i>O</i> very commonly becomes <i>a</i>, as <i>archet</i>, orchard, <i>tharn</i>, thorn,
<i>vant</i>, font, <i>vram</i>, from, <i>carn</i>, corn.</p>

<p>Quite as commonly it takes the <i>au</i> or <i>aw</i> sound, as <i>hawp</i>,
hope, <i>aupen</i>, open, <i>cawls</i>, coals, <i>hawle</i>, hole, <i>smawk</i>, smoke.</p>

<p>In such words as <i>cold</i> and <i>four</i>, the sound is <i>ow</i> rather than
<i>aw</i>, thus giving us <i>cowld</i> and <i>vower</i>.</p>

<p><i>Moss</i> in S. Wilts sometimes takes the long <i>e</i>, becoming <i>m&#275;sh</i>,
while in N. Wilts it would merely be <i>mawss</i>.</p>

<p><i>Know</i> becomes either <i>knaw</i> or <i>kneow</i>.</p>

<p><i>O</i> is often sounded <i>oo</i>, as <i>goold</i>, gold, <i>cwoort</i>, court, <i>mwoor'n</i>
or <i>moor'n</i>, more than, <i>poorch</i>, porch.</p>

<p><i>Oo</i> is sometimes shortened into <i>&#365;</i>, as <i>shut</i>, shoot, <i>sut</i>, soot,
<i>tuk</i>, took.</p>

<p>Very commonly the sound given to <i>&#333;</i> is <i>wo</i> or <i>woä</i>. Thus
we get <i>twoad</i>, toad (sometimes <i>twoad</i>), <i>pwoast</i>, post, <i>bwoy</i>, boy,
<i>rwoäs</i>, a rose, <i>bwoän</i>, bone, <i>spwoke</i> (but more usually <i>spawk</i> in
N. Wilts), spoke.</p>

<p><i>Oa</i> at the beginning of a word becomes <i>wu</i>, as <i>wuts</i>, oats.</p>

<p><i>Oi</i> in <i>noise</i> and <i>rejoice</i> is sounded as <i>ai</i>.</p>

<p>In <i>ointment</i> and <i>spoil</i> it becomes <i>&#299;</i> or <i>w&#299;</i>, giving <i>intment</i> and
<i>spile</i> or <i>spwile</i>.</p>

<p><i>Ow</i> takes the sound of <i>er</i> or <i>y</i>, in some form or other, as
<i>vollur</i> and <i>volly</i>, to follow, <i>winder</i> and <i>windy</i>, a window.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><i>U</i> in such words as <i>fusty</i> and <i>dust</i> becomes <i>ow</i>, as <i>fowsty</i>,
<i>dowst</i>.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><i>D</i> when <ins title="Note: original shows 'followed'">preceded</ins> by a liquid is often dropped, as <i>veel'</i>, field,
<i>vine</i>, to find, <i>dreshol</i>, threshold, <i>groun'</i>, ground.</p>

<p>Conversely, it is added to such words as <i>miller</i>, <i>gown</i>, <i>swoon</i>,
which become <i>millard</i>, <i>gownd</i>, and <i>zownd</i>.</p>

<p>In <i>orchard</i> and <i>Richard</i> the <i>d</i> becomes <i>t</i>, giving us <i>archet</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
and <i>Richut</i> or <i>Rich't</i>; while occasionally <i>t</i> becomes <i>d</i>, <i>linnet</i>
being formerly (but not now) thus pronounced as <i>linnard</i>
in N. Wilts.</p>

<p><i>D</i> is dropped when it follows <i>n</i>, in such cases as <i>Swinnun</i>,
Swindon, <i>Lunnon</i>, London.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><i>Su</i> sometimes becomes <i>Shu</i>, as <i>Shusan</i>, Susan, <i>shoot</i>, suit,
<i>shewut</i>, suet, <i>shower</i>, sure, <i>Shukey</i>, Sukey.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><i>Y</i> is used as an aspirate in <i>yacker</i>, acre, <i>yarm</i>, arm, <i>yeppern</i>,
apron, <i>yerriwig</i>, earwig. It takes the place of <i>h</i> in <i>yeäd</i>, head,
<i>yeldin</i>, a hilding; and of <i>g</i> in <i>yeat</i> or <i>yat</i>, a gate.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>Consonants are often substituted, <i>chimney</i> becoming <i>chimbley</i>
or <i>chimley</i>, <i>parsnip</i>, <i>pasmet</i>, and <i>turnip</i>, <i>turmut</i>.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>Transpositions are very common, many of them of course
representing the older form of a word. For examples we may
take <i>ax</i>, to ask, <i>apern</i>, apron, <i>girt</i>, great, <i>wopse</i>, wasp, <i>aps</i>, the
aspen, <i>claps</i>, to clasp, <i>cruds</i>, curds, <i>childern</i>, children.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><i>F</i> almost invariably becomes <i>v</i>, as <i>vlower</i>, flower, <i>vox</i>, fox,
<i>vur</i>, far, <i>vall</i>, fall, <i>vlick</i>, flick, <i>vant</i>, font.</p>

<p>In such words as <i>afterclaps</i> and <i>afternoon</i> it is not sounded
at all.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><i>L</i> is not sounded in such words as <i>amwoast</i>, almost, and
<i>a'mighty</i>, almighty.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><i>N</i> final is occasionally dropped, as <i>lime-kill</i>, lime-kiln.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><i>P</i>, <i>F</i>, <i>V</i>, and <i>B</i> are frequently interchanged, <i>brevet</i> and <i>privet</i>
being forms of the same word, while to <i>bag</i> peas becomes <i>fag</i>
or <i>vag</i> when applied to wheat.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><i>R</i> is slurred over in many cases, as <i>e'ath</i>, earth, <i>foc'd</i>, forced,
<i>ma'sh</i>, marsh, <i>vwo'th</i>, forth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span></p>

<p>It often assumes an excrescent <i>d</i> or <i>t</i>, as <i>cavaltry</i>, horsemen,
<i>crockerty</i>, crockery, <i>scholard</i>, scholar.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><i>H</i> has the sound of <i>wh</i> in <i>whoam</i>, home. This word,
however, as Mr. Slow points out in the Preface to his
Glossary&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Drat if I dwon't goo <i>wom</i> to marrer.</p>

<p><i>Zam.</i> Wat's evir waant ta go <i>wimm</i> var.</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Why, they tell's I as ow Bet Stingymir is gwain to be caal'd
<i>whoam</i> to Jim Spritely on Zundy.&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>is variously pronounced as <i>wom</i>, <i>wimm</i>, and <i>whoam</i>, even in the
same village.</p>

<p>As stated at page 72, the cockney misuse of <i>h</i> is essentially
foreign to our dialect. It was virtually unknown sixty or
seventy years ago, and even so late as thirty years back was
still unusual in our villages. <i>Hunked</i> for <i>unked</i> is almost the
only instance to be found in Akerman, for instance. But the
plague is already fast spreading, and we fear that the Catullus
of the next generation will have to liken the Hodge of his day
to the Arrius (the Roman 'Arry) of old:&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">C<i>h</i>ommoda dicebat, si quando commoda vellet<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Dicere, et <i>h</i>insidias Arrius insidias ...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ionios fluctus, postquam illuc Arrius isset,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Iam non Ionios esse, sed <i>H</i>ionios.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Touching this point the Rev. G. Hill writes us from Harnham
Vicarage as follows:&mdash;'I should like to bear out what you
say with regard to the use of the letter <i>h</i> in South-West Wilts.
When I lived in these parts twenty years ago, its omission was
not I think frequent. The putting it where it ought not to
be did not I think exist. I find now that the <i>h</i> is invariably
dropped, and occasionally added, the latter habit being that of
the better educated.'</p>

<p><i>H</i> becomes <i>y</i> in <i>yeäd</i>, head.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><i>K</i> is often converted into <i>t</i>, as <i>ast</i>, to ask, <i>mast</i>, a mask, <i>bleat</i>,
bleak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span></p>

<p><i>T</i> is conversely often replaced by <i>k</i>, as <i>masking</i>, acorn-gathering,
from 'mast,' while sleet becomes <i>sleek</i>, and pant,
<i>pank</i>.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><i>S</i> usually takes the sound of <i>z</i>, as <i>zee</i>, to see, <i>zaa</i>, a saw,
<i>zowl</i>, soul, <i>zaat</i> or <i>zate</i>, soft, <i>zider</i>, cider, <i>zound</i>, to swoon.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><i>Thr</i> usually becomes <i>dr</i>, as <i>dree</i>, three, <i>droo</i>, through, <i>draish</i>,
to thrash.</p>

<p>In <i>afurst</i>, athirst, and <i>fust</i>, thirst, we still retain a very
ancient characteristic of Southern English.</p>

<p><i>T</i> is always dropped in such words as <i>kept</i> and <i>slept</i>, which
become <i>kep'</i> and <i>slep'</i>.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>Liquids sometimes drop the next letter, as <i>kill</i>, kiln; but
more usually take an excrescent <i>t</i> or <i>d</i>, as <i>varmint</i>, vermin,
<i>steart</i>, a steer, <i>gownd</i>, gown.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><i>W</i> as an initial is generally dropped in N. Wilts in such
cases as <i>'oont</i>, a want or mole, <i>'ooman</i>, woman, <i>'ood</i>, wood.</p>

<p>Occasionally in S. Wilts it takes the aspirate, <i>'ood</i> being
then <i>hood</i>.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>Final <i>g</i> is always dropped in the present participle, as <i>singin'</i>,
<i>livin'</i>, living; also in nouns of more than one syllable which end
in <i>ing</i>. It is, however, retained in monosyllabic nouns and
verbs, such as <i>ring</i> and <i>sing</i>.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><i>Pre</i> becomes <i>pur</i>, as <i>purtend</i>, pretend, <i>purserve</i>, preserve.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>Sometimes a monosyllabic word will be pronounced as a
dissyllable, as we have already mentioned, <i>ne-um</i>, <i>ve-ut</i>, <i>ve-us</i>,
and <i>ke-up</i> being used concurrently with <i>naayme</i>, <i>vit</i> or <i>fit</i>, <i>veäce</i>,
and <i>kip</i> or <i>keep</i>.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>The prefix <i>a</i> is always used with the present participle, as
<i>a-gwain'</i>, going, <i>a-zettin' up</i>, sitting up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span></p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>The article <i>an</i> is never used, a doing duty on all occasions,
as 'Gie I a apple, veyther.'</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>Plurals will be found to be dealt with in the <cite>Glossary</cite> itself,
under <i>En</i> and <i>Plurals</i>.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>Pronouns will also be found grouped together under
<i>Pronouns</i>.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><i>As</i> is used for <i>who</i>, <i>which</i>, and <i>that</i>.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>Active verbs govern the nominative case.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>Verbs do not agree with their nominative, either in number
or person.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>The periphrastic tenses are often used in S. Wilts, as 'I do
mind un,' but in N. Wilts the rule is to employ the simple
tenses instead, merely altering the person, as 'I minds un.' In
S. Wilts you might also say 'It be a vine night,' whereas in
N. Wilts ''Tes a vine night' would be more correct.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>In conclusion we would mention that we hope in the course
of the next year or two to be able to deal with the grammatical
and phonological sides of our Dialect in a somewhat more
adequate manner than it has been possible to do on the
present occasion.</p>

<p class="hang"><b>Hyle</b>, <b>Hile</b>, <b>Aisle</b>, &amp;c. (1) <i>n.</i> A shock or cock of wheat, consisting

but now varies considerably, according to the crop.
<small>Tithing</small> in N.W. <small>Hile-a-whate</small> (S.) The forms given by
Davis, <i>aisle</i>, <i>aile</i>, and <i>isle</i>, seem purely fanciful, as also does
the derivation there suggested, a <i>hyle</i> being merely a single
shock. In some parts of Wilts the shape and size of a hyle
will depend largely on the weather at harvest-time. Thus
in a stormy season it will usually be built compact and
round, while in a calm one it may sometimes form a line
several yards in length.&mdash;S.W.</p>

principle is to get three pieces together in a line anywhere
on the dots or holes, while at the same time preventing your
adversary from making a line. 'Nine-penny,' 'Six-penny,'
and 'Three-penny' differ only in the number of men each
side and the form of the board (<i>see diagrams</i>). The 'board'
is scratched or chalked out on paving-stones, drawn on the
slate, cut deep into the turf on the downs, or the top of
the corn-bin (with holes instead of dots), in short, made

<blockquote>

<p>'The handle of a "squailer" projected from Orion's coat-pocket.
For making a squailer a tea-cup was the best mould:... A ground ash
sapling with the bark on, about as thick as the little finger, pliant
and tough, formed the shaft, which was about fifteen inches long.
This was held upright in the middle of a tea-cup, while the mould was
filled with molten lead. It soon cooled, and left a heavy conical knob
on the end of the stick. If rightly thrown it was a deadly missile,
and would fly almost as true as a rifle ball. A rabbit or leveret could
thus be knocked over; and it was peculiarly adapted for fetching
a squirrel out of a tree, because, being so heavy at one end, it rarely
lodged on the boughs, as an ordinary stick would, but overbalanced
and came down.'&mdash;<cite>Amateur Poacher</cite>, ch. iii.</p>

<p>'The "squaler" came into use very early in the school's history,
and was for years almost as much a part of the ordinary equipment
of a Marlborough boy as a cricket-bat would now be. To later generations
the very name probably conveys no meaning. The weapon itself
was simple enough, though extremely formidable. It consisted of
a piece of lead something the shape and about the size of a pear, with
a cane handle about eighteen inches long. A squaler could be thrown
a great distance and with terrific force, and at short ranges by the
practised hands of the Marlburians of those days with great accuracy.
Its ostensible purpose was squirrel-hunting, as the name suggests [No,
it is not a contraction of "squirreller," but is from <i>squail</i>, to throw.&mdash;<i>G.E.D.</i>],
but it came in handy for the larger quarry which the more
adventurous tribes pursued and slew, such as rabbits, hares, and very
frequently even deer. It lingered on as an article of local sale till the
middle of the sixties; but ... was made contraband, and finally died
out.'&mdash;<cite>History of Marlborough College</cite>, ch. ix. p. 94.</p>

<p>'To make a squailer you provide yourself with an eighteen-inch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
length of half-inch cane, two inches of which you sheath with tow
and then insert in a ladle of molten lead. There you manipulate it in
such sort that there is presently left to cool at the end of your cane
a pear-shaped lump of lead of the weight experience has shown you to
be proper. With this weapon an adept can bring down a squirrel from
on high, or stop one on the level at five-and-twenty yards, almost to
a certainty.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">W. F. Waller</span> in <cite>Notes &amp; Queries</cite>, 8th series, ii. p. 197.
'Another Marlborough mode of making it is to pour the melted lead
into a cone composed of many folds of well-wetted paper, tied round
the slightly notched upper end of the cane or ground ash.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">G. E.

At Clyffe Pypard the word has a yet stronger idea of disease
about it, and a 'white-livered' woman is popularly supposed
to be almost as dangerous as was the poison-nurtured Indian
beauty who was sent as a present to Alexander the Great.
How the 'whiteness' of the liver is to be detected is not
very clear, but probably it is by the pallor of the face. At
any rate, if you discover that a young woman is 'white-livered,'
do not on any account marry her, because the whiteness
of the liver is of a poisonous nature, and you assuredly
will not live long with a white-livered young woman for your

remains between them a strip, two furrows wide, still unploughed.
This is 'the Ent,' and is halved by the plough,
one half being turned up one way, and the other half the
other way. There remains then a furrow just twice the
ordinary width. The plough is taken down this, and half
of it is turned up again on one side, the result being a narrow

work by a few somewhat longer specimens, which may be
taken as accurately representing the speech current at the present

<p>It's oondervul to me how thengs <em>do</em> move about whenever a body's
got a drap o' zummut in's yead. Last harrest, a'ter zupper, at th'
house yander, I walked whoam by myzelf, and zeed the moon and
the zeven stars dancin' away like vengeance. Then they girt elmen
trees in the close was a dancin' away like Bill Iles and his mates
at a morris. 'My zarvice to 'e,' zays I; 'I haups you won't tread
on my twoes;' zo I went drough a sheard in th' hedge, instead o'
goin' drough th' geat. Well, when I got whoam, I managed to vind
the kay-hole o' th' doower&mdash;but 'twas a lang time afore I could get
un to bide still enough,&mdash;and got up stayers. Massy upon us! the
leetle table (I zeed un very plain by the light o' th' moon) was
runnin' round th' room like mad, and there was th' two owld chayers
runnin' a'ter he, and by and by, round comes the bed a'ter they two.
'Ha! ha!' zays I, 'that's very vine; but how be I to lay down
while you cuts zich capers?' Well, the bed comed round dree
times, and the vowerth time I drowd myzelf flump atop ov un; but
in th' marnin' I vound myzelf laying on the vloor, wi' ael me duds
on! I never <em>could</em> make out this.</p>

<p>I've allus bin as vlush o' money as a twoad is o' veathers; but,
if ever I gets rich, I'll put it ael in Ziszeter bank, and not do as owld

couldn't remember whereabouts 'twas, and had to pull purty nigh

zo I allus axes vor more than I wants. Iv I gets that, well and good;
but if I axes vor little, and gets less, it's martal akkerd to ax a zecond

when a run agin the jackass one dark night. Jem tuk th' beawst

<p>Old Iles was drunk vor dree days together last Lammas, and a laid

<p>Measter Goddin used to zay as how childern costed a sight o' money

zucked th' mother, but when um begun to zuck the vather, 'twas

<p>When I was a young man I had a dog, a precious 'cute un a was
too! A'd catch a hare like a grayhound. I've cot a scare o' rabbuts
wi' him in one night. By and by zomebody zays to the kippur, thuck
William's got a dog as plays th' devil wi' ael th' game. Zo th' kippur
comes up to m' one day, and zays, zays he, 'Maester Little, thuck
dog o' yourn's a bad un; a gwos huntin', I'm towld.' 'Lar bless'e!'
zays I, 'a wou'dn't harm a mouse, that a wou'dn't.'&mdash;'Dwon't
b'lieve it!' zays he. 'Come along wi' I by thuck copse yonder.'&mdash;Zo
as us walked alang, up jumps a hare and away a scampers.
'Hollo! hollo!' zays I to the dog, but a slunk behind m' <em>di</em>rectly
wi's tail between's legs. 'Ha!' zays th' kippur, 'I b'lieves 'e now,
Little. Them as zays your dog hunts be liars, that's zartin. I'll
be cussed if I dwon't thenk a's vrightened o' th' game, that I do!'
and zo a walked away, and wished m' good marnin'.&mdash;'Zo, ho!'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
thought I; 'you be 'nation 'cute, you be, Maester Kippur. If
instead o' "<i>hollo</i>!" I'd a cried "<i>coom hedder</i>!" a'd a run a'ter thuck
hare like mad!'</p>

<p>[<i>Note.</i>&mdash;The point of this story is that the poacher's dog had been
trained to understand the usual orders in <i>exactly the opposite sense</i>,
as the Devonshire smugglers' horses were in old days. Thus, the
more a smuggler called on his horse to stop, when he was challenged
by an Excise officer, the faster it would gallop off, the owner all the
while apparently endeavouring to check it but really urging it on.

<h2><a name="APPENDIX_I" id="APPENDIX_I">APPENDIX I</a></h2>

<p class="center">A Bibliography of Works relating to Wilts or
illustrating its Dialect.</p>


<p>Most of the works comprised in the following list have lately
been read through, and compared with our own <cite>Glossary</cite>, and
references to many of them will be found in the foregoing
pages. Some may contain a more or less comprehensive Wiltshire
Glossary; others only a few words. Some belong absolutely
to our own county; others merely to the same group of
dialects. But all are of value as bearing on the subject. The
Berks, Dorset, Gloucester, Hants, and Somerset Glossaries of
course contain a large proportion of words and uses that are
either absolutely identical with ours, or vary but slightly therefrom,
while such works as <cite>Amaryllis, Dark, Lettice Lisle</cite>, and
<cite>Jonathan Merle</cite> on the one side, and <cite>Old Country Words</cite> and
<cite>English Plant-names</cite> on the other, are full of examples and
illustrations of the South-Western Folk-speech. Even where
their scene is laid somewhat outside the borders of Wilts
itself, the dialect, with but trifling alterations, would pass
as ours.</p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX_II" id="APPENDIX_II">APPENDIX II</a></h2>

<p class="center">Cunnington MS.</p>


<p>Among the various books and word-lists which we have
consulted during the progress of this work, by no means the
least interesting is the manuscript containing a <cite>Collection of
a few Provincial Terms used in North Wilts</cite>, believed to have
been compiled about the middle of last century, which was
kindly lent us by its present owner, Mr. William Cunnington,
and is here frequently referred to as <cite>Cunnington MS.</cite></p>

<p>This valuable relic was at one time in the possession of
Mr. J. Britton, as is proved by the notes in his <em>early</em> handwriting
on the outer leaves, and was evidently the source to which he
was indebted for some portions of his 1825 <cite>Glossary</cite> (in the
<cite>Beauties of Wilts</cite>, vol. iii), the very peculiar wording and spelling
of some of its paragraphs having been transferred direct to his
pages. It must, however, have been in his hands at a much
earlier date than 1825, as one or two of the notes appear to
have been made at the time he was collecting materials for the
1814 volume on Wilts.</p>

<p>Not only has it afforded us several hitherto un-noted words,
which Mr. Britton himself had passed over, possibly because
even in his own time they were already grown obsolete, but
it has also enabled us to clear up several doubtful points, and
especially to show how, by a very simple misreading of the
MS., from the easily identified <i>sprawny</i> (a variant of <i>sprunny</i>)
was evolved that mysterious 'ghost-word' <i>sprawing</i>, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
has ever since misled our glossary-makers, each one having
seemingly taken it on the faith of his immediate predecessor.</p>

<p>The <cite>Vocabulary</cite>, which we here reproduce <i>verbatim et literatim</i>,
consists of ten quarto pages, the first two of which are covered
with notes in pencil and ink, in at least four different hands,
partly archæological and topographical, and partly relating to
dialect words in Wilts and elsewhere. It is written in an
extremely legible old hand, with a few additions and interlineations
in other hands, and contains about one hundred words
and phrases, of which we owe just two-thirds to the original
compiler, who is supposed to have been a North Wilts clergyman.
If so, it is probable that his very characteristic handwriting
could readily be identified by any one who was familiar
with our last-century parish registers.</p>

<p>The interlineations have been made at different dates and
in different hands, <i>acrass</i>, <i>chit</i>, <i>clout</i>, <i>gallered</i>, <i>hire</i>, <i>hitch</i>, <i>muxen</i>,
<i>shirk off</i>, <i>slink away</i>, <i>skillin</i>, <i>stowl</i>, <i>stole</i>, <i>thick</i> and <i>thuck</i>, <i>won't</i>,
with the numerals at the end, being in pencil, two or three
of them having been inked over at some time or other; while
<i>arran</i>, <i>clavey</i>, <i>clap to</i>, <i>desperd</i>, <i>dowse</i>, <i>hit</i>, <i>nan</i>, <i>plye</i>, <i>rathe</i>, <i>sprawny</i>,
the definition of <i>thick</i> and <i>thuck</i>, <i>tun</i>, <i>tag</i>, <i>twit</i>, and <i>vuddels</i>, are
in ink, and mostly in a much larger and somewhat peculiar
hand. The pencilling is now almost entirely obliterated.</p>

<p>The MS. was given by Mr. Britton to Mr. Cunnington, with
other books and papers, many years ago, and its existence
appears to have been unknown until we called attention to it
in the <cite>Wilts Archæological Magazine</cite>, vol. xxvi. p. 293.</p>

<p class="center">Monthly Magazine Word-list.</p>


<p>In the <cite>Monthly Magazine</cite>, Sept. 1814, vol. xxxviii. p. 114,
a short and very badly arranged list of South Wilts Words and
Phrases occurs. We have thought it best to reproduce it here,
<i>verbatim et literatim</i>, from the Magazine itself, kindly lent us by
Mr. Cunnington, as the account given of it in the Preface to
Professor Skeat's reprint of Akerman is in some respects
slightly inaccurate. Thus, he omits all mention of <i>Hogo</i> and
some other words or phrases, while <i>Tatees</i> is misquoted as <i>taters</i>
and <i>Theseum</i> as <i>Thescum</i>. The remarks made on the latter word
will therefore require some modification.</p>


<p class="center">Prefatory Note.</p>

<p><i>To the Editor of the Monthly Magazine.</i> Sir, In conformity
to your invitation, I send you some specimens of the provincial
dialect of South Wiltshire.</p>
